IMPLEMENTATION AUDIT
Date: 2026-02-06
App: FinAnalyze (SME Financial Health Platform)

==================================================
1. FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
==================================================

[X] FEATURE 1: Inventory Handling
    - Implementation: "Snapshot" approach (Separated from Financial Uploads)
    - Storage: Backend 'inventory_snapshots' (Logical/In-Memory per session)
    - UI: New 'inventory' upload type, dedicated chart in Dashboard.
    - Logic: Direct parsing override (100% confidence) for Inventory CSVs.

[X] FEATURE 2: Loan / Credit Obligations
    - Implementation: "Obligations" module
    - Storage: Backend 'loan_obligations'
    - UI: New 'loan' upload type.
    - Logic: Direct parsing override. Used for Credit Readiness analysis.

[X] FEATURE 3: Automated Bookkeeping
    - Implementation: Deterministic categorization of bank statement rows.
    - Logic: Keyword matching (e.g., "rent", "salary", "upwork") -> Category.
    - Output: Monthly Income/Expense breakdown.

[X] FEATURE 4: Financial Forecasting
    - Implementation: 3-Month Projection (Linear Trend)
    - Logic: Avg(Last 3 Months) * GrowthFactor(1.02).
    - Status: Purely mathematical, no AI hallucination.

[X] FEATURE 5: Working Capital Optimization
    - Implementation: Receivables vs Payables analysis.
    - Logic: (Receivables - Payables) = Gap. Risk levels assigned based on Gap vs Revenue.

[X] FEATURE 6: GST Integration (Mock)
    - Implementation: Mockoon API integration.
    - Status: Frontend fetches from localhost:3001/api/gst/overview.
    - Fallback: Graceful error if Mockoon not running.

[X] FEATURE 7: Multilingual Support
    - Implementation: React Context (LanguageContext).
    - Languages: English, Hindi, Telugu.
    - Scope: UI Strings + AI Explanations.

[X] FEATURE 8: Report Export
    - Implementation: PDF Generation (jspdf).
    - Content: Executive Summary, Forecast, Risk Analysis, AI Insights.

==================================================
2. TECHNOLOGY STACK & CONSTRAINTS COMPLIANCE
==================================================

Backend:
- FastAPI (Python)
- Pandas (Data Processing)
- Mistral 7B (via API) for Explanations only.
- Strict Rule: NO Schema Changes (All data associated via auth tokens/logical mapping).

Frontend:
- React + Vite + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts
- jspdf (New dependency)

Constraints Adherence:
- No Database Schema Changes: PASSED.
- No Breaking Existing Flows: PASSED (Bank upload still works as step 1).
- Deterministic Financials: PASSED (Calculations are pure math).
- AI Containment: PASSED (AI only used for text explanations "Why/What/Action").

==================================================
3. KNOWN LIMITATIONS (HACKATHON CONTEXT)
==================================================
1. Data Persistence: Relies on `localStorage` and backend in-memory/file-session for demo purposes.
2. GST Data: Is mocked. Real integration requires Government API credentials.
3. PDF Layout: optimized for standard A4, may need adjustment for very long tables.
4. DB Constraint Workaround: 'Inventory' and 'Loan' files are saved as 'bank' type in DB to bypass schema constraints, using filename prefixes [INVENTORY]/[LOAN] for identification.

==================================================
4. VERIFICATION STEPS
==================================================
1. Upload 'bank_statement.csv' -> Dashboard populates.
2. Upload 'inventory_list.csv' -> Inventory chart appears.
3. Select 'Hindi' -> Dashboard translates.
4. Click 'Export Report' -> PDF downloads.
